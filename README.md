# Create Your Own Object Chasing Robot
This project demonstrates how to create your own object chasing robot using machine learning, a Raspberry Pi, and Intel's Neural Compute Stick 2. This guide will hopefully jump start your own real-time object detecting robot.

## Project Overview
This guide will teach you how to: 
* train your own model in TensorFlow using a Transfer Learning technique to save time and money 
* optimize the resulting TensorFlow model to be utilized with Intel's Inference Engine
* implement the
